Conclusion
This project serves as a simple example of how machine learning can be applied to medical data to classify diseases. However, it is important to note that this is a simplified example, and the results may not be representative of real-world performance. Additionally, this project does not take into account important factors such as ethical considerations and interpretability of the model.
